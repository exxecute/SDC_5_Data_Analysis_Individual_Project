# Presentation of the topic

## 1. Project title
**Analysis of Global Natural Resources: Consumption, Extraction, and Depletion Forecasting**

---

## 2. Project objective
- To investigate current reserves and extraction rates of natural resources (oil, gas, coal, water, food, energy in general).  
- Determine the dynamics of resource consumption by country and region.  
- Forecast the time of possible resource depletion at current consumption rates.  
- Conduct visual and statistical analysis of data, including PCA and clustering.  
- Provide recommendations for the rational use of resources.

---

## 3. Justification for choosing this topic
- **Relevance:** The depletion of natural resources and climate change are global challenges.  
- **Data availability:** The World Bank, BP Statistical Review, FAO, and Our World in Data provide high-quality public data.  
- **Analysis methods:** The project allows the use of EDA, visualization, statistical tests, PCA, and clustering.
- **Educational value:** Demonstration of skills in working with Python and R, analytical and statistical thinking.

## 4. Methods and tools

| Project stage | Tool | Methods |
|-------------|------------|--------|
| Preliminary analysis | Python (pandas, numpy) | Descriptive statistics, data verification, handling missing values |
| Visualization | Python (matplotlib, seaborn) | Histograms, boxplots, violin plots, scatter plots, cat plots |
| Hypothesis testing | R (stats, t.test, ANOVA, chisq.test) | t-test, ANOVA, χ², region comparison |
| Multivariate analysis | Python (scikit-learn) | PCA, KMeans, clustering, principal component visualization |
| Depletion forecast | Python / R | Consumption extrapolation, calculation of “Years to depletion” |

---

## 5. Expected results
- Tables and graphs showing the distribution of reserves and consumption of resources by country and region.
- Visualization of consumption trends over recent years.
- Identification of countries with high and low levels of consumption and resource security.  
- Clusters of countries with similar resource profiles.
- Forecast of when key resources may be depleted at current consumption rates.
- Recommendations for rational resource use.
